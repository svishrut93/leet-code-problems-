Calculate the angle between hour hand and minute hand of a clock - also called the clock angle problem 


The idea is to take 12:00 (h = 12, m = 0) as a reference. Following are detailed steps. 1) Calculate the angle made by hour hand with respect to 12:00 in h hours and m minutes.
2) Calculate the angle made by minute hand with respect to 12:00 in h hours and m minutes.
3) The difference between two angles is the angle between two hands.Note : There are fornulae to find the angle made by the hour hand and the angle made by the minute hand.


How to calculate the two angles with respect to 12:00? 
The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minute(or 6 degrees in one minute) and hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours(or 0.5 degrees in 1 minute). In h hours and m minutes, the minute hand would move (h*60 + m)*6 and hour hand would move (h*60 + m)*0.5. 
 
 
 // Java program to find angle between hour and minute hands
import java.io.*;

class GFG 
{
	// Function to calculate the angle
	static int calcAngle(double h, double m)
	{
		// validate the input
		if (h <0 || m < 0 || h >12 || m > 60)
			System.out.println("Wrong input");

		if (h == 12)
			h = 0;
		if (m == 60)
		{
			m = 0;
			h += 1;
			if(h>12)
			h = h-12;
		} 

		// Calculate the angles moved by hour and minute hands
		// with reference to 12:00
		int hour_angle = (int)(0.5 * (h*60 + m));
		int minute_angle = (int)(6*m);

		// Find the difference between two angles
		int angle = Math.abs(hour_angle - minute_angle);

		// smaller angle of two possible angles
		angle = Math.min(360-angle, angle);

		return angle;
	}
	
	// Driver Code
	public static void main (String[] args) 
	{
		System.out.println(calcAngle(9, 60)+" degree");
		System.out.println(calcAngle(3, 30)+" degree");
	}
}
