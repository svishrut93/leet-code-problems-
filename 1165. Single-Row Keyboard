There is a special keyboard with all keys in a single row.

Given a string keyboard of length 26 indicating the layout of the keyboard (indexed from 0 to 25), initially your finger is at index 0. 
To type a character, you have to move your finger to the index of the desired character. The time taken to move your finger from index i to index j is |i - j|.

You want to type a string word. Write a function to calculate how much time it takes to type it with one finger.

class Solution {
    public int calculateTime(String keyboard, String word) {
        int pos=0, totalTime = 0;
        char c ; 
        int index ;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < word.length() ; i++){
            c = word.charAt(i);
            index = findIndex(c,keyboard);
            totalTime+= Math.abs(index - pos);
            pos = index ; 
        }
        return totalTime; 
    }
    
    public int findIndex(char c , String keyboard){
        //Lets do a linear search 
        for (int i=0 ; i < keyboard.length() ; i++){
            if (keyboard.charAt(i)==c)
                return i ; 
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
